# welcome to the GLUE_CPP README.

This repository is an eigen-analysis reduction code which allows the user to study the ratios of the eigenvalues of an ellipsoidal particle distribution.
The shell fit functionality allows the user to conduct an analysis which finds the 2D ellipse dimesions which best encapsulate constant-density shells. This is a fully parallelized code. 

All documentation is in the wiki, located here: https://github.com/danecross/GLUE_CPP/wiki
